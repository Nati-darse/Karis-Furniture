              Our Journey
            </h2>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Karis Furniture began in 2010 with a simple belief: furniture should tell a story. 
              What started as a one-man workshop has grown into a team of dedicated craftsmen 
              united by a passion for creating pieces that stand the test of time.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The name "Karis" comes from the Greek word for grace and kindnessâ€”values that 
              guide our approach to both our craft and our clients. We believe that beautiful 
              furniture should be accessible, sustainable, and built to become part of your 
              family's story.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Today, we continue to blend traditional woodworking techniques with modern design, 
              creating custom pieces that reflect both our heritage and our vision for the future 
              of sustainable furniture making.
            </p>
            
            <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-amber-600 pl-6 italic text-gray-700 text-xl my-12">
              "We don't just build furniture; we craft the soul of your home. 
              Every piece carries the mark of its maker and the story of its owner."
